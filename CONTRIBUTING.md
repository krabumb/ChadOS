# Contributing to ChadOS

First of all, thank you for checking out **ChadOS** !

This project is a **personal passion project**. Our goal is to learn, experiment, and have fun building an operating system from scratch.

## No External Contributions
We are **not** looking for outside code contributions, pull requests, or feature branches.  
ChadOS is intentionally kept as a closed development effort between the original authors.

## Feedback Welcome
That being said, we **do welcome feedback**:  
- Open an **Issue** if you have ideas, questions, or suggestions.  
- Share your thoughts if something is unclear or could be improved.
- Discussion is encouraged, as collaboration on the *conceptual* level is always appreciated.

## Thanks
Even if youâ€™re not contributing code, just checking out ChadOS or leaving feedback helps us stay motivated.  
This project is made with love (and a **lot** of madness), thanks for being part of the journey !
